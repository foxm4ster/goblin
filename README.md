Welcome to **Goblin**, a deceptively simple Go library for managing daemons ‚Äî small in size, mighty in magic, and always up to a bit of mischief. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

## Features

- üåÄ **Awaken Your Daemons**: Goblin awakens your daemons, starting them up and putting them to work.
- ü™Ñ **Graceful Shutdown**: Goblin ensures your daemons rest peacefully.
- üßª **Goblin Vibe**: Every action, failure, and success is sprinkled with a dash of goblin chaos.

## How It Works

Goblin creates a **daemon manager** that can handle multiple daemons(horde) and control their lifecycle. Each daemon is a mischievous creature in its own right, and Goblin ensures they follow your commands (or at least tries its best!). With a playful approach to error handling and logging, Goblin never fails to entertain while it works its magic.

### Daemon Interface

In your codebase you just need to implement the `Daemon` interface to pass it into Goblin. Goblin will handle the rest.

```go
type Daemon interface {
    // The name of the daemon (used for logs and tracking)
    Name() string

    // Bring the daemon to life!
    Serve() error

    // Shutdown the daemon gracefully (hopefully without a fight)
    Shutdown() error
}
```

### Example Usage

```go

// Define a daemon
myDaemon := &MyDaemon{}

// Define another daemon
srv := NewHTTPServer(addr, handler)

gob := goblin.New(
    goblin.WithLogbook(logger),
    goblin.WithDaemon(myDaemon, srv),
)

if err := gob.Awaken(); err != nil {
    logger.Error("goblin couldn‚Äôt awaken", "cause", err)
}
```

Use `AwakenContext` to awaken a daemon with a custom `context.Context`. This is useful when you want to manage cancellation or timeouts more precisely.

```go

ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
defer cancel()

if err := gob.AwakenContext(ctx); err != nil {
    logger.Error("goblin couldn‚Äôt awaken", "cause", err)
}
```
